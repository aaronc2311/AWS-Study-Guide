S3 Glacier Deep Archive: $0.00099 (lowest cost, retrieval takes up to 48 hours).

Tip with answer:
“Which S3 class is best for long-term data that’s rarely retrieved, at the lowest cost?”
Answer: S3 Glacier Deep Archive.​



EBS (Elastic Block Store)
What it is: Persistent block storage for EC2, like a hard drive.

Key features: Tied to single AZ, can snapshot/restore, supports different performance types.

Pricing (per GB per month):

General Purpose SSD (gp3): $0.08.

General Purpose SSD (gp2): $0.10.

Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2): $0.125 plus IOPS fees.

Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): $0.045.

Cold HDD (sc1): $0.015.

Tip with answer:
“Which storage is persistent, can be used as boot volumes for EC2, and supports snapshots?”
Answer: Amazon EBS.



EFS (Elastic File System)

Key features: NFS access, shared by multiple EC2 instances, auto-scaling.

Pricing (per GB per month):

EFS Standard: $0.30 (frequent access).

EFS Infrequent Access: $0.016.

EFS Archive: $0.008.

Tip with answer:
“Which storage lets multiple EC2 instances share files and grows/shrinks automatically?”
Answer: Amazon EFS.



RDS (Relational Database Service)
What it is: Managed SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Pricing info: You pay for underlying storage and compute. Common storage cost is $0.115/GB/month for general-purpose SSD.

What is the cheapest AWS storage option for archiving data you’ll rarely access, possibly once per year?
Answer: S3 Glacier Deep Archive – as low as $0.00099 per GB per month.

Which storage type is best for hosting databases on EC2?
Answer: EBS – because it provides block-level storage with strong performance and durability.

Scenario: You have regulatory requirements to keep data for 10+ years at minimal cost. Which storage?
Answer: S3 Glacier Deep Archive.



You should be able to choose quickly:

Large object store, accessed over HTTP → S3.

Block storage for EC2, needs low‑latency disk → EBS.

Shared POSIX file system for multiple EC2 instances → EFS.

Long‑term archive, rarely accessed data → S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

For databases:

Relational, SQL, transactions → RDS.

Key‑value/NoSQL, massive scale → DynamoDB.

Analytics/OLAP, petabyte‑scale warehouse → Redshift.

In‑memory caching to speed reads → ElastiCache.
