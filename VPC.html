		<h1>AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define.</h1>

		You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 for most resources in your VPC

		As one of AWS's foundational services, Amazon VPC makes it easy to customize your VPC's network configuration. You can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that have access to the internet. It also lets you place your backend systems, such as databases or application servers, in a private-facing subnet with no internet access. Amazon VPC lets you to use multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in each subnet.

		Flow Logs
		You can monitor your VPC flow logs delivered to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon CloudWatch to gain operational visibility into your network dependencies and traffic patterns, detect anomalies and prevent data leakage, and troubleshoot network connectivity and configuration issues.

		IP Address Manager (IPAM)
		IPAM makes it easier for you to plan, track, and monitor IP addresses for your AWS workloads. IPAM automates IP address assignments to your Amazon VPC, removing the need to use homegrown or spreadsheet-based planning applications. It also enhances your network observability by showing IP usage across multiple accounts and VPCs in a unified operational view.

		
		
		Ingress Routing:
		With this feature, you can route all incoming and outgoing traffic flowing to/from an internet gateway or virtual private gateway to a specific Amazon EC2 instance’s elastic network interface. 
		Public subnet needs a Internet gateway. An internet gateway enables resources in your public subnets (such as EC2 instances) to connect to the internet if the resource has a public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.

		Private subnet needs a network address translation (NAT) gateway: A network address translation (NAT) gateway allows EC2 instances to establish outbound connections to resources on internet without allowing inbound connections to the EC2 instance. It's not possible to use the private IP addresses assigned to instances in a private VPC subnet over the internet. Instead, you must use NAT to map the private IP addresses to a public address for requests. Then, you must map the public IP address back to the private IP addresses for responses.		



		Network Access Control List
		A network access control list (network ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. 

		Security Groups
		Create security groups to act as a firewall for associated Amazon EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. When you launch an instance, you can associate it with one or more security groups. If you don’t specify a group, the instance is automatically associated with the VPC’s default group. Each instance in your VPC can belong to a different set of groups. Learn more about security groups here.

		Traffic Mirroring
		This feature allows you to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface of Amazon EC2 instances and send it to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances for deep packet inspection. You can detect network and security anomalies, gain operational insights, implement compliance and security controls, and troubleshoot issues. Traffic Mirroring gives you direct access to the network packets flowing through your VPC.

		<h1>AWS Transit Gateway: connects your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks through a central hub.</h1>

		AWS Transit Gateway connects your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks through a central hub. This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. It acts as a cloud router – each new connection is only made once.

		As you expand globally, inter-Region peering connects AWS Transit Gateways together using the AWS global network. Your data is automatically encrypted and never travels over the public internet. And, because of its central position, AWS Transit Gateway Network Manager has a unique view over your entire network, even connecting to Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) devices.
