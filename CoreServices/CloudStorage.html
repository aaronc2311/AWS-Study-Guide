		Object storage – S3 and Glacier
		Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage for virtually unlimited data, accessed over HTTP/HTTPS via APIs or URLs. It’s ideal for backups, data lakes, static websites, logs, and application assets.
		
		S3 storage classes: Standard (frequent access), Standard‑IA, One Zone‑IA, Glacier Instant, Glacier Flexible Retrieval, Glacier Deep Archive for progressively colder/cheaper storage with higher retrieval cost/latency.
		
		Key ideas: Buckets and objects, 11 9s durability, lifecycle policies (automatic tiering to Glacier), server‑side encryption, bucket policies.

		File storage – EFS and FSx
		Amazon EFS (Elastic File System): Managed, POSIX‑compliant file system for Linux, shared across many EC2 instances in a region. It auto‑scales capacity and is good for web/app servers that need shared files.
		
		Amazon FSx: Managed high‑performance file systems (e.g., Windows FSx for Windows File Server, FSx for Lustre) for specialized workloads 	needing Windows semantics or HPC file systems.
	</div>

	<div>
		Archive storage – S3 Glacier family
		S3 Glacier services: Ultra‑low‑cost storage for archives where access is rare and slower retrieval is acceptable.
		
		Tiers differ by retrieval time and price: Instant Retrieval (fast, more expensive), Flexible Retrieval (minutes‑hours), Deep Archive (hours‑days, cheapest).
		
		Exam example (answer):
		“Cheapest option for compliance archives you might never read again.”
		Answer: S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
