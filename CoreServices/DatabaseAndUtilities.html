	<h1>Core Services: </h1>
		<div>RDS</div>
		Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
		What it is: Managed SQL database (supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server).
		
		Key features: Automated backups, patching, scaling, multi-AZ for failover, read replicas for scaling reads.
		
		Pricing: Pay for instance size (CPU/RAM), storage used, and I/O, with on-demand or reserved instance options (up to 70% savings).
		
		Exam tip with answer:
		“Which AWS service provides managed, scalable SQL (relational) databases?”
		Answer: Amazon RDS.
				
		When to use: High consistency, transactions, complex queries, and relational data.



		<div>DynamoDB</div>
		Amazon DynamoDB
		What it is: Managed NoSQL, key-value and document database, scales to millions of requests/sec.
		
		Key features: Single-digit millisecond latency, on-demand or provisioned capacity, automatic scaling, built-in security, backup/restore, global tables.
		
		Pricing: On-demand or provisioned (lower rates); reserved capacity can save up to 77% for long-term commitments.
		
		Exam tip with answer:
		“Which AWS service provides a fast, scalable NoSQL database with single-digit millisecond latency?”
		Answer: DynamoDB.
		
		When to use: Flexible schema, massive scale, high throughput, serverless backend, IoT, mobile/web apps.
		
		Caching: Use DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator) for microsecond, in-memory caching.



		<div>Elasticache</div>
		Amazon ElastiCache
		What it is: Ultra fast managed in-memory cache using Redis or Memcached engines.
		
		Key features: Sub-millisecond latency, distributed, scales easily, integrated for caching reads from RDS/DynamoDB to improve performance; supports clustering and replicas.
		
		Pricing: Pay per node instance hour (e.g., cache.m5.large: ~$0.156/hr plus data transfer); reserved node pricing saves further.
		
		Exam tip with answer:
		“Which AWS service improves database performance and saves cost for read-heavy workloads by caching data in memory?”
		Answer: ElastiCache.
		
		When to use: Hot, frequently-read data, reduce latency for web apps, gaming leaderboards, session storage.



		<div>Redshift</div>
		Amazon Redshift
		What it is: Managed cloud data warehouse for large-scale analytics (OLAP), petabyte scale, columnar storage.
		
		Key features: Columnar storage (fast queries), massively parallel processing (MPP), integrates with business intelligence tools.
		
		Pricing: Pay per node (compute cluster), plus storage; reserved node costs save up to 75%.
		
		Exam tip with answer:
		“Which AWS service is best for analyzing petabytes of structured data and running complex queries?”
		Answer: Amazon Redshift.
		
		When to use: Big data analytics, business intelligence, reporting.
		
		Redshift vs RDS: RDS for transactions, Redshift for analytics.


		Exam Tips: 
		If asked about read-heavy applications needing faster performance:
		Answer: Add ElastiCache to cache results and reduce load on primary database.
		
		If asked how to scale millions of transactions per second, flexible schema:
		Answer: Use DynamoDB.
		
		If asked about backup and failover for relational databases:
		Answer: Enable RDS Multi-AZ for failover, use read replicas for scaling reads.
		
		If asked for the analytics solution over terabytes and petabytes of data:
		Answer: Use Amazon Redshift.
