				<h1>Virtual Private Cloud VPC</h1> 
				AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define.
				You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 for most resources in your VPC

				As one of AWS's foundational services, Amazon VPC makes it easy to customize your VPC's network configuration. You can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that have access to the internet. It also lets you place your backend systems, such as databases or application servers, in a private-facing subnet with no internet access. Amazon VPC lets you to use multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in each subnet.

				<h1>AWS Transit Gateway: connects your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks through a central hub.</h1>

				AWS Transit Gateway connects your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks through a central hub. This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. It acts as a cloud router – each new connection is only made once.

				As you expand globally, inter-Region peering connects AWS Transit Gateways together using the AWS global network. Your data is automatically encrypted and never travels over the public internet. And, because of its central position, AWS Transit Gateway Network Manager has a unique view over your entire network, even connecting to Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) devices.

		<div>Application Networking</div>
	
			AWS AppMesh: is a service mesh that provides application-level networking to make it easy for your services to communicate with each other across multiple types of compute infrastructure. 
			Modern applications are typically composed of multiple services. Each service may be built using multiple types of compute infrastructure such as Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Fargate. As the number of services grow within an application, it becomes difficult to pinpoint the exact location of errors, re-route traffic after failures, and safely deploy code changes. AppMesh alleviates those problems. 
			You can use App Mesh with AWS Fargate, Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and Kubernetes running on AWS, to better run your application at scale. App Mesh also integrates with AWS Outposts for your applications running on-premises. App Mesh uses the open source Envoy proxy, making it compatible with a wide range of AWS partner and open source tools.
