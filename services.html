			<h1>Active Directory Connector: Redirect directory requests to your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory.</h1>

			AD Connector is a directory gateway with which you can redirect directory requests to your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory without caching any information in the cloud. AD Connector comes in two sizes, small and large. You can spread application loads across multiple AD Connectors to scale to your performance needs. There are no enforced user or connection limits. 

			AD Connector does not support AD transitive trusts. AD Connectors and your on-premises AD domains have a 1-to-1 relationship. That is, for each on-premises domain, including child domains in an AD forest that you want to authenticate against, you must create a unique AD Connector.

			AD Connector cannot be shared with other AWS accounts.
			

			Once set up, AD Connector offers the following benefits:
				Your end users and IT administrators can use their existing corporate credentials to log on to AWS applications such as WorkSpaces, Amazon WorkDocs, or Amazon WorkMail.
				You can manage AWS resources like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon S3 buckets through IAM role-based access to the AWS Management Console.
				You can consistently enforce existing security policies (such as password expiration, password history, and account lockouts) whether users or IT administrators are accessing resources in your on-premises infrastructure or in the AWS Cloud.
				You can use AD Connector to enable multi-factor authentication by integrating with your existing RADIUS-based MFA infrastructure to provide an additional layer of security when users access AWS applications.

			<h1>API Gateway: Build, deploy, and manage APIs.</h1>

			Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. 
			Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

			API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. 
			API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. 
			You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.
			

			API Types: RESTful & WEBSOCKET
				Build RESTful APIs optimized for serverless workloads and HTTP backends using HTTP APIs. HTTP APIs are the best choice for building APIs that only require API proxy functionality. If your APIs require API proxy functionality and API management features in a single solution, API Gateway also offers REST APIs.

				Build real-time two-way communication applications, such as chat apps and streaming dashboards, with WebSocket APIs. API Gateway maintains a persistent connection to handle message transfer between your backend service and your clients.

			<h1>AppFlow: No-code integration for SaaS apps & AWS services.</h1>

			Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to securely TRANSFER DATA between Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, SAP, Zendesk, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.

			With AppFlow, you can run data flows at enterprise scale at the frequency you choose - on a schedule, in response to a business event, or on demand.

			AppFlow automatically encrypts data in motion, and allows users to restrict data from flowing over the public Internet for SaaS applications that are integrated with AWS PrivateLink, reducing exposure to security threats.

			Data privacy defaults through PrivateLink: (AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and your on-premises networks, without exposing your traffic to the public internet.)
			AWS PrivateLink simplifies the security of data shared with cloud-based applications by eliminating the exposure of data to the public Internet. For SaaS applications that have PrivateLink enabled, AppFlow automatically creates and configures private endpoints so your data remains private by default.
			All data flowing through AppFlow is encrypted at rest and in transit, and you can encrypt data with AWS keys, or bring your own custom keys.
			You can use your existing AWS identity and access management (IAM) policies to enforce fine-grained permissions and keep access consistent across your organization, without creating new policies. 

			Point and click user interface
			A point and click user interface enables you to select your data sources and destinations, configure optional transformations and validations, and run your flow.

			Easy to use field mapping
			You use the AppFlow interface to map source and destination fields together all at once through bulk mapping, or map each field one at a time. For data flows with a large number of fields, you can also upload a csv file to map many fields quickly.

			Pay as you go
			Amazon AppFlow offers significant cost-savings advantage compared to building connectors in-house or using other application integration services. There are no upfront charges or licensing fees to use AppFlow, and customers only pay for the number of flows they run and the volume of data processed.

			High scale data transfer
			Amazon AppFlow can run up to 100 GB of data per flow, which enables you to easily transfer millions of Salesforce records, Marketo leads or Zendesk tickets - all while running a single flow.

			<h1>CloudFront: global content delivery network (CDN).</h1>

			Reduce latency by delivering data through 410+ globally 
			dispersed Points of Presence (PoPs) with automated network mapping and intelligent routing.

			Delivers: websites, stream live and on-demand video, accelerate dynamic content delivery and API's. 

			Example: upload static content to an S3 bucket, that will be used as a CLoudFront origin. S3 is a good choice for an Amazon CloudFront origin that includes static content such as images, videos, HTML pages, .css files, and .js files. Navigate to S3 and click Create Bucket button. Next select upload and Add Files. Go to Set permissions tab. You will need to make the image publicly readable (by default, S3 buckets are set to private). 

			Enter the CloudFront cosole: Create Distribution. 
			A web distribution specifies configuration settings so CloudFront knows which origin to get your content from when a user requests it. You can use Amazon S3 buckets (storage folders) and HTTP servers (for example, web servers) as an origin. A web distribution is used for static and dynamic content while the RTMP distribution is optimal for streaming media files using Adobe Flash Media Server's RTMP protocol. 

			Configure your web distribution: Once you configure your distribution, CloudFront will create the distribution and propagate it throughout the CloudFront network for you to use.  Select Create Distribution.  
			After this process is complete, your status column will change from In Progress to Deployed.

			Test your link:
			After you create your web distribution, you can test it out by confirming that CloudFront gets your object from the origin and returns it to a web browser.  For this test, you will need the CloudFront domain name from Step 4 and the image name you uploaded to the S3 bucket in step 1.
			copy and paste the following: 
			<html>
				<head>My CloudFront Test</head>
				<body>
					<p>My text content goes here.</p>
					<p><img src="http://domain name/object name" alt="my test image"></p>
				</body>
			</html>
			Save the text in a file as mycloudfronttest.html, open web browser and ensure you can see your content. 

			Disable your distribution:
			You can easily disable the distribution from the CloudFront console. In fact, it is a best practice to disable distributions you are no longer using so you don’t keep getting charged for them. However, make note that when a distribution is disabled, any website supported by that distribution will be down and the content will no longer be accessible to end users.
