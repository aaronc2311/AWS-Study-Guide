Define the AWS shared responsibility model:
The AWS Shared Responsibility Model defines that AWS is responsible for the "security of the cloud", covering the physical infrastructure (hardware, software, networking, facilities) that runs AWS services. Customers are responsible for "security in the cloud", managing their data, configuring their virtual machines and security settings, and patching their operating systems and applications. Responsibilities vary based on the AWS service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), with customers taking on more responsibility as they move towards Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).  

What AWS is Responsible For:
Physical Infrastructure: Maintaining the physical data centers, servers, networking, and the facilities themselves. 
Global Infrastructure: Managing the AWS global network, including its regions and availability zones. 
Underlying Services: Ensuring the hardware and operating systems that AWS provides are updated, patched, and secure. 

What the Customer is Responsible For:
Data: Protecting your own data, including its encryption and backup strategies. 
Guest Operating System: Patching, updating, and securing the operating system running on your cloud instances. 
Applications and Software: Securing the applications and other software you deploy within the cloud. 
Configuration of Security: Properly configuring the security group firewalls, Identity and Access Management (IAM), and other security services provided by AWS. 
Network Controls: Managing the network configuration and traffic within their deployed resources.
