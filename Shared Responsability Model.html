		<h1>Shared Responsability Model: The customer assumes responsibility and management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches), other associated application software as well as the configuration of the AWS provided security group firewall.</h1>

		AWS responsibility “Security of the Cloud” - 
		AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.

		Customer responsibility “Security in the Cloud” – 
		Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects. This determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities. For example, a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is categorized as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and, as such, requires the customer to perform all of the necessary security configuration and management tasks. Customers that deploy an Amazon EC2 instance are responsible for management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches), any application software or utilities installed by the customer on the instances, and the configuration of the AWS-provided firewall (called a security group) on each instance. For abstracted services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, AWS operates the infrastructure layer, the operating system, and platforms, and customers access the endpoints to store and retrieve data. Customers are responsible for managing their data (including encryption options), classifying their assets, and using IAM tools to apply the appropriate permissions.

	The shared responsibility model says AWS and the customer split security and compliance duties: AWS secures the cloud itself, and customers secure what they run and store in the cloud.​

Core idea and exam phrase
AWS is responsible for security of the cloud (infrastructure, hardware, managed services platform).

Customers are responsible for security in the cloud (configuring services securely, protecting data, identities, and applications).

Exam tip (answer):
“If a question says ‘security of the cloud vs security in the cloud’, who owns which?”
Answer: AWS = security of the cloud; customer = security in the cloud.

What AWS is responsible for
AWS responsibilities mainly cover the underlying platform:

Physical facilities and data centers (building security, power, HVAC).

Hardware, networking, and virtualization layer (servers, storage devices, routers, hypervisor).

Core managed infrastructure services and their OS/platform layer (for example, the underlying OS for S3, DynamoDB, RDS hosts).

Exam tip (answer):
“Who is responsible for securing AWS data center facilities and physical hosts?”
Answer: AWS is responsible for physical security and infrastructure security.

What the customer is responsible for
Customer responsibilities always include:

Data: classification, encryption choices, backup strategy, access control to data.

Identity & access: IAM users, groups, roles, policies, MFA, least-privilege access.

Application security: code, libraries, app configs, secret management, app-level encryption.

Resource configuration: network rules (security groups, NACLs), S3 bucket policies, logging settings.

Compliance & training: mapping controls, staff training, internal processes and audits.

Exam tip (answer):
“If a question asks who must correctly configure S3 bucket permissions or security groups?”
Answer: The customer is responsible for secure configuration of its AWS resources.

How it changes by service type
The more managed the service, the more AWS does—but the customer always owns data and permissions.

IaaS (e.g., EC2):

AWS: physical hosts, networking, hypervisor.

Customer: guest OS patching, OS firewall, applications, data, security groups.


PaaS / managed DB (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB):

AWS: infrastructure, DB engine installation, host OS, some patching/backup mechanics.

Customer: schema design, user accounts inside DB, query security, data protection, IAM access.


Fully managed/abstracted (e.g., S3, Lambda):

AWS: infrastructure, platform OS, runtime environment.

Customer: code (for Lambda), data, access policies, encryption settings, bucket/function configuration.


Exam tip (answer):
“On EC2, who patches the guest operating system?”
Answer: The customer patches the EC2 guest OS; AWS handles the underlying infrastructure.

Exam tip (answer):
“For S3 and DynamoDB, what is the customer always responsible for?”
Answer: Managing data (including classification and encryption) and access permissions via IAM and resource policies.


Shared / overlapping controls
Some controls are shared: AWS does part; the customer completes it.

Patch management: AWS patches infrastructure; customers patch guest OS, apps, and dependencies.

Configuration management: AWS configures its internal devices; customers configure their own OS, DBs, applications, and service settings.

Awareness & training: AWS trains its staff; customers train their own staff.


Exam tip (answer):
“When a control is ‘shared’ (like patch management), what does that mean?”
Answer: AWS patches the underlying cloud infrastructure; customers patch their own operating systems, applications, and configurations.

Typical exam scenarios with answers
Use these as mental flashcards:

“A company misconfigured an S3 bucket and exposed data. Under the shared responsibility model, who is responsible?”
Answer: The customer is responsible for securely configuring S3 bucket permissions and protecting its data.

“Who is responsible for enabling encryption of data at rest in S3 or RDS?”
Answer: The customer chooses and configures encryption options; AWS provides the mechanisms and manages underlying infrastructure.

“Who is responsible for IAM user management and enabling MFA?”
Answer: The customer manages IAM identities and MFA for its AWS accounts.

“What benefit does the shared responsibility model give customers?”
Answer: It offloads physical and infrastructure security to AWS while letting customers focus on securing their data, identities, and configurations.



You should be crystal clear that:

AWS handles security of the cloud: data centers, physical hosts, networking, hypervisor.

Customers handle security in the cloud: IAM, OS and application patching (on EC2), data encryption choices, S3 bucket policies, security groups, NACLs.

Practice answering:

Misconfigured S3 bucket or open security group → always the customer’s responsibility.

Patching EC2 guest OS → customer; patching underlying infrastructure → AWS.
