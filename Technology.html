	<div>Define methods of deploying and operating in the AWS Cloud</div>
	Deploying and operating in the AWS Cloud involves various methods for provisioning resources, deploying applications, and managing the ongoing lifecycle of your infrastructure and applications.
	1. Deployment Methods:
	Manual Deployment: Direct interaction with the AWS Management Console to provision and configure resources and upload application code. This method is suitable for small-scale deployments or initial testing but lacks automation and scalability.
	Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Defining and provisioning infrastructure using code, such as AWS CloudFormation, AWS CDK, or Terraform. This enables version control, reusability, and automated provisioning of resources.
	Managed Deployment Services: Utilizing AWS services designed for specific application types, like AWS Elastic Beanstalk for web applications, AWS CodeDeploy for automating application deployments to various compute platforms, or AWS Lambda for serverless functions.
	Container-Based Deployments: Deploying applications within containers using services like Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), or AWS Fargate. This offers portability, scalability, and consistent environments.
	CI/CD Pipelines: Implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines with services like AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy to automate the entire software release process from code commit to deployment.
	2. Operating Methods:
	Monitoring and Logging: Utilizing services like Amazon CloudWatch for collecting metrics and logs, AWS CloudTrail for auditing API calls, and Amazon Kinesis for real-time data streaming to gain insights into application and infrastructure performance.
	Automated Scaling: Implementing auto-scaling groups for Amazon EC2 instances or configuring scaling policies for other services to automatically adjust resource capacity based on demand, ensuring performance and cost optimization.
	Security Management: Employing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for managing user permissions, AWS WAF for protecting web applications, AWS Security Hub for security posture management, and other security services to secure your cloud environment.
	Cost Management: Utilizing AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and other tools to monitor and control cloud spending, identify cost optimization opportunities, and forecast future costs.
	Backup and Disaster Recovery: Implementing backup strategies using services like AWS Backup or Amazon S3, and designing disaster recovery plans with services like AWS Site Recovery or Amazon Route 53 for high availability and business continuity.
	Operational Automation: Automating routine operational tasks using services like AWS Systems Manager, AWS Lambda, or custom scripts to reduce manual effort and improve operational efficiency.



	<div>Define the AWS global infrastructure</div>
	AWS global infrastructure is an extensive network of globally distributed data centers designed for secure, reliable, and high-performance cloud computing. It comprises Regions, each containing multiple isolated Availability Zones (AZs) with independent power, networking, and connectivity, and connected to Edge Locations and Regional Edge Caches to deliver content closer to users worldwide. This architecture enables high availability, scalability, disaster recovery, and compliance for applications. 





	<div>Identify the core AWS services</div>
	Core AWS services include Amazon EC2 (virtual servers), Amazon S3 (object storage), Amazon RDS (managed relational databases), Amazon VPC (virtual private cloud), AWS IAM (identity and access management), and AWS Lambda (serverless compute). These fundamental services provide computing, storage, networking, and security capabilities to build and run applications in the cloud.
	




	<div>Identify AWS resources for technology support</div>
	AWS provides a range of support resources, including the AWS Support Center for creating support cases, the AWS Support App for Slack integration, and various documentation and community forums like AWS re:Post for technical information and troubleshooting. For proactive insights, AWS Trusted Advisor offers recommendations on cost optimization, security, and performance, while the AWS Resource Explorer helps discover and manage your resources across AWS services.
