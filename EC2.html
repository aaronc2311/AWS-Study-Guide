EC2:
AWS EC2, or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, provides resizable, secure, virtual computing capacity in the cloud, allowing users to run virtual servers (instances) for a wide range of workloads without needing to manage physical hardware. It offers high flexibility, scalability, and control over operating systems, storage, and security, enabling developers to host applications, run big data processing, develop and test environments, and train machine learning models.
