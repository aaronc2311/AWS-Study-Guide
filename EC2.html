EC2:
AWS EC2, or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, provides resizable, secure, virtual computing capacity in the cloud, allowing users to run virtual servers (instances) for a wide range of workloads without needing to manage physical hardware. 

What Is EC2?
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Virtual servers in AWS for running applications.

Instance: A single virtual machine, created from an AMI (Amazon Machine Image), using specified CPU, RAM, networking, and storage.

Common Use Cases: Web hosting, development, batch processing, application servers.


Key Concepts
AMI: A template with OS and software to launch EC2 instances.

Instance Types: Preset combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking. Categories include:

General Purpose

Compute Optimized

Memory Optimized 

Storage Optimized 

Accelerated Computing 


EBS (Elastic Block Store): Persistent disk volumes for data storage; can detach/reattach to instances.

Security Groups: Virtual firewalls controlling traffic to/from instances.

Elastic IPs: Static public IPs that can be remapped between instances.


EC2 Pricing Models
On-Demand: Pay per second or hour for usage with no long-term commitment. Flexible and ideal for short-term or unpredictable workloads.

Reserved Instances: Commit to a 1- or 3-year term for up to 75% discount over On-Demand. Best for predictable workloads, and can be paid fully upfront, partial, or monthly.

Savings Plans: Flexible alternative—commit to a certain dollar amount per hour for compute use (across instance families/types) in exchange for lower rates, 1- or 3-year terms.

Spot Instances: Purchase unused compute for up to 90% off On-Demand prices. Can be interrupted, best for batch, stateless, or fault-tolerant jobs.

Dedicated Hosts/Instances: Physical servers dedicated to your use—compliance and licensing needs. More advanced, less common for Cloud Practitioner but worth knowing.

Other Important Features
Auto Scaling: Automatically add/remove instances based on demand.

Elastic Load Balancer: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple EC2 instances for better availability.

Monitoring: Use CloudWatch to monitor, alert, and log instance metrics.


Exam Tips
Know which pricing model fits which use case—On-Demand for flexible workloads, Reserved/Savings for steady, Spot for cost-sensitive/batch.

Recognize basic instance type categories (General Purpose, Compute, Memory, Storage).

Understand the difference between EBS (persistent) and instance storage (ephemeral).

Security groups are “virtual firewalls”—restrict/allow traffic based on rules.

EC2 Exam Tips With Answers
Which pricing model is best for steady, predictable workloads?
Answer: Reserved Instances (offer significant savings for 1- or 3-year commitments).

Which model is best for flexible, short-term, or unpredictable compute usage?
Answer: On-Demand Instances (pay as you go, no long-term commitment).

Which EC2 pricing is best for cost-sensitive, interruption-tolerant batch jobs?
Answer: Spot Instances (up to 90% off but can be interrupted by AWS).

What acts as the virtual firewall for EC2?
Answer: Security Groups (control inbound/outbound traffic to/from instances).

What is an AMI and what is it used for?
Answer: An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a template that contains the OS and software to launch an EC2 instance..

Which storage option is persistent even if an EC2 instance is stopped or restarted?
Answer: EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes (will persist), whereas Instance Store does not persist after stop/termination.

If a company needs high memory but little CPU, which instance type should they choose?
Answer: Memory Optimized Instance (e.g., r5, x1).

Are EC2 resources (like instances, EBS volumes, Security Groups) global or regional?
Answer: Regional (tied to a specific AWS Region and Availability Zone).

How can you automatically scale EC2 resources up and down?
Answer: Use Auto Scaling Groups (respond to demand by launching/stopping instances automatically).

How can you monitor EC2 performance metrics and receive alerts?
Answer: CloudWatch (collects logs, metrics, and provides alarms).

What service distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple EC2 instances?
Answer: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
